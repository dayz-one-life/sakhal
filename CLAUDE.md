# CLAUDE.md

This repository holds the server configuration for a **DayZ Sakhal** server. It was created
from the Claude Code workflow template; the workflow below is enforced by committed hooks in
`.claude/` and streamlined by repo-level skills.

## Server configuration

The repository root contains the DayZ mission config, based on the official `dayzOffline.sakhal`
set:

- **Economy / loot:** `cfgeconomycore.xml`, `cfgspawnabletypes.xml`, `cfgrandompresets.xml`,
  `cfglimitsdefinition*.xml`, and `db/` (`types.xml`, `events.xml`, `globals.xml`, `economy.xml`).
- **Map groups & spawns:** `mapgroup*.xml`, `mapcluster*.xml`, `cfgplayerspawnpoints.xml`,
  `cfgeventspawns.xml`, `cfgeventgroups.xml`.
- **Environment / AI territories:** `cfgenvironment.xml`, `cfgweather.xml`, and `env/` (per-animal
  and zombie territory files).
- **Gameplay & entry points:** `cfggameplay.json`, `config.cpp`, `init.c`, plus effect/area and
  underground trigger config.

Edits are vetted against the official DayZ config schemas; changes flow through the workflow below.

## On session start

A SessionStart hook injects a role-aware orientation. **Present that orientation to the
user at the start of a fresh session.**

## The workflow

1. All feature work happens on a **fork**, on a `feature/*` branch.
2. Updating this file (`CLAUDE.md`) is the **last step** before opening a PR.
3. `CHANGELOG.md` is updated on **every** PR.
4. PRs go into the canonical repo's **`develop`** branch.
5. Reviews are done in Claude Code and posted back to the contributor.
6. Approved PRs are **squash-merged** into `develop`.
7. Production releases go out via a **`develop` → `main`** PR.
8. Merging that PR **cuts a release** with notes.

## Skills

- Contributor: `starting-work`, `finishing-a-feature`.
- Maintainer: `reviewing-a-contribution`, `merging-a-contribution`, `drafting-a-release`, `cutting-a-release`.
- Setup: `workflow-setup` (run once).

## Guardrails (enforced by `.claude/hooks/guard.py`)

- No commits, pushes, or merges on `main`/`develop` (tag pushes and the one-time `workflow.json` setup commit are exempt).
- On a fork: PRs must target `develop` and require CHANGELOG.md + CLAUDE.md updates.
- On the canonical repo: feature work is blocked (fork instead). Fork contributions into `develop` must be squash-merged and approved; the maintainer's own same-repo release/back-merge PRs are exempt from that gate.
- Once the project is initialized (`workflow-setup` run), write/git actions are blocked unless the Superpowers plugin is installed.
- **Solo maintainer mode:** setting `soloMaintainer: true` in `.claude/workflow.json` activates a `solo` role that holds the union of contributor + maintainer permissions from a single clone (no remote swapping). Protected branches stay PR-only; contribution merges into `develop` still require `--squash` + a posted review (a `COMMENTED` review counts, since self-approval is impossible); release (`develop`→`main`) and back-merge (`main`→`develop`) PRs are exempt from the changelog/review gates. Off by default.

## Honest limitations

- Hooks only bind inside Claude Code; plain `git`/`gh` in a shell bypasses them.
- Superpowers/role detection are filesystem/remote heuristics; they fail with clear messages.
- Approved-review detection needs the canonical repo to be a real GitHub remote.

## Configuration

`.claude/workflow.json` holds `canonicalRepo`, branch names, the optional `soloMaintainer` flag (default `false`), and optional `commands.test`/`commands.lint`.
